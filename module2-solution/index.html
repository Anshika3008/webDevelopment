    <h1>FREEDOM FIGHTERS</h1>
    <h2>Mahatma Gandhi</h2>
    <article>Born on 2nd October 1869, Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi is revered as Father of the Nation for his immense sacrifices for India. He not only ushered India towards freedom, but he also became the inspiring figure for many independence struggles and rights movements across the world. Popularly called Bapu, Gandhi introduced the doctrine of non-violence in India. According to him, independence was to be achieved through a combination of non-violent movement and non-co-operation with the British. His credit lies in the fact that he was able to bring the masses into the freedom struggle. The historic Non-Cooperation movement, Dandi March and the Quit India movement were all started under his leadership.</article>
    <h2>Subhash Chandra Bose</h2>
    <article>One of the greatest Indian freedom fighters that history witnessed was none other than Subhas Chandra Bose. He was born on 23rd January 1897. He was a radical nationalist and his ultimate patriotism carved a hero out of him. Bose belonged to the extremist section of the Indian freedom fighters. He was the leader of a radical youth wing of Congress from the early years of the 1920s till the end of 1930. Bose disagreed with the ideals of non-violence promoted by Gandhi, instead of believing that only armed revolt could oust the British from India. The founder of the Forward Bloc, he escaped the eyes of the British to ultimately reach Germany during the second world war. He raised the Indian National Army (INA) and with Japanese help, was able to free a portion of Indian territory from the British in Manipur, but was ultimately defeated due to Japanese surrender to the British. Although he is believed to have died in a plane crash in 1945, his death remains shrouded in mystery to date.</article>
    <h2>Lal Bahadur Shastri</h2>
    <article>Lal Bahadur Shastri was born on 2nd October 1904 in the state of Uttar Pradesh. He was conferred with the title of Shastri which in English is termed as Scholar. At the age of only sixteen, he left his studies to join the non-cooperation movement at the call of Gandhi. Later, he graduated with a first-class degree from Kashi Vidyapeeth, a national institution of higher education inaugurated by Gandhi. He was one of the most proactive Indian freedom fighters who participated in various movements such as the Quit India movement, Civil Disobedience movement and other satyagrahas led by Mahatma Gandhi. Lal Bahadur Shastri was incarcerated by the British for considerable periods during his lifetime. Post attaining independence, he first became the Home Minister and later was made the Prime Minister of India in the year 1964.</article>
